### Abstract

This project explores Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) control using the DE1-SoC FPGA development board. The core objective is to implement a system that manages two LEDs and two segments of a 7-segment display through hardware-level PWM signals. The system is designed using VHDL and simulates real-world embedded control techniques that balance brightness and timing precision. The project includes both hardware schematics and software logic to ensure a modular and scalable design. Through simulation and hardware testing, we verified the consistency and performance of the PWM output and its interaction with visible elements. This project serves as a foundational example for students interested in digital logic design, hardware description languages, and FPGA development.  

The main contributions of the project are:

* Implementation of a dual-channel PWM controller using VHDL.
* Integration of PWM outputs with LEDs and 7-segment display segments.
* Verification of the design through simulations and on-board demonstration.

## Hardware Description of Demo Application

The application runs on the DE1-SoC board, utilizing its built-in LEDs and 7-segment display modules. The system uses two PWM modules: one driving two LEDs with variable duty cycles, and another controlling two 7-segment digits for brightness modulation. The following schematic represents the top-level hardware design:

## Software Description

The PWM control logic is implemented in VHDL. The project includes modular design elements, with clearly defined signal flow and control structure. The main software components are:

* A clock divider to scale down the input clock.
* A PWM generator module with adjustable duty cycle.
* A control unit to assign duty cycles based on switches or input.

Below are diagrams showing the flow of the software logic:
